# Miscanthus assimilation data

Assimilation in Miscanthus as measured in Naidu et al. (2003). The first
column is the observed net assimilation rate (micromoles m^-2 s^-1). The
second column is the observed quantum flux (micromoles m^-2 s^-1). The
third column is the temperature (degrees Celsius). The fourth column is
the observed relative humidity in proportion (e.g. 0.7).
