# Miscanthus assimilation field data

Assimilation in Miscanthus as measured in Beale, Bint, and Long 1996.
The first column is the observed net assimilation rate (micromoles m^-2
s^-1). The second column is the observed quantum flux (micromoles m^-2
s^-1). The third column is the temperature (degrees Celsius). Relative
humidity was not reported and thus was assumed to be 0.7.

## Format
