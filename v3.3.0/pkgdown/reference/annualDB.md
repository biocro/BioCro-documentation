# Miscanthus dry biomass data.

The first column is the thermal time. The second, third, fourth, and
fifth columns are miscanthus stem, leaf, root, and rhizome dry biomass
in Mg ha⁻¹ (root is missing). The sixth column is the leaf area index.
The `annualDB.c` version is altered so that root biomass is not missing
and LAI is smaller. The purpose of this last modification is for testing
some functions.

## Format

Data frame of dimensions 5 by 6.
